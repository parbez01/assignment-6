We have a navbar where on one side there is a picture in the middle a button called shot by view and on the other side there is a button called blog whenever we click on the block button all my recent blocks will be shown.
Then we have some routers called All Music Comedy and Drawing.And below I have a lot of data in a section where each video lens is given along with their name and subscriber related data.When we click on all round then all the data will show, if we click on music round it will show music data, if we click on comedy rowdy it will show comedy related and if we click on drawing it will show read data.
